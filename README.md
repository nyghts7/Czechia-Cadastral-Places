Updated data for populated places in Czechia.

 

Comparison with previous data:

previous data had 6,254 populated places, for a total population of 10,511,389

new data has 14,461 populated places, for a total populated of 10,414,021

the difference in population is due to the difference in census years used, as data for cadastal places is more outdated, but is far more representative of the breakdown of people in Czechia, hence its use

 

population data comes from pop-stat.mashke, while coordinates come from openstreetmap via overpass-turbo
